## Academic-Projects-R
This repository contains all of my R projects completed for my university degree (Computer Science and Econometrics). As I am studying in Poland, most of them are in Polish. Most of them have knitted R-Markdown html files. 

### Renewable energy [PL]
#### Intro
Basic analysis of the world's usage of renewable sources of energy and an attempt to look for reasons as to why some countries clearly have a higher percentage of using renewable sources compared to the rest of alternatives.
#### Packages
Packages needed to knit the file:
* library(dplyr)
* library(tidyr)
* library(mice)
* library(ggplot2)
* library(psych)
* library(ggthemes)
#### Additional Information
To knit the file user should change the working directory - second chunk of code <my_source <- "C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Renewable_Energy/DANE">. The data I am working with is included in DATE. Data comes straight from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/).
